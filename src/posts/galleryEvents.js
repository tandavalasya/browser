    content: `# PanchaBhootha Sthalam 2017\n\nThis recital was based on the Pancha Bhootha Sthalam of Lord Shiva. I had worked on the entire research work of every sthalam and had visited the sthalams to validate its sthala puranam.\n\nIt is based on the legends of the places dedicated to the 5 elements of nature; space, air, fire, water and land. I represented air completely and also took up other roles with respect to the other sthalams.\n\nThe songs included a vrutham followed by a keerthanam succeeded by a closing sloka about the respective sthalam. Every element included its origin, legends concerning Gods and Goddesses and present day Kaliyuga references.\n\nThese songs were composed just for this production by Shri KaviKannan. The music was composed by our very own vocalist Shri Kaushik Champakesan and the jathis were by the renowned percussionist Shri Chenda Keshavan.\n\nThe entire repertoire was choregraphed by my guru Smt. Bhagyashree Satthish. The chreography included an introduction to the element using the Karanas and charis from the Natyashastra followed by the choregraphy to the Keerthanam.\n\nThis production had brought in a lot of laurels to the dance school and fetched us shows abroad to stage the same.`
